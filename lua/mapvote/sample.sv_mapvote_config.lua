# MapVote Config
See readme.md for general information. 

## **FIRST THINGS FIRST...**
- Change this files name to `sv_mapvote_config.lua` (remove the `sample`). This will make it usable.
- **This addon will replace your current map system.** Mainly meaning, if you have them on fastdl, you'll have to find them on the Steam Workshop, or add them to the workshop yourself.
  - If you don't want to do this, consider [the original addon](https://github.com/tyrantelf/gmod-mapvote) or [my fork with only map previews](https://github.com/funczone/mapvote_with_previews).

-- MapVote config. See: https://github.com/tyrantelf/gmod-mapvote#ttt-and-deathrun-setup

    MapLimit = 24,           -- number, the number of maps shown on the vote screen.
    TimeLimit = 28,          -- number, how long the vote is shown for.
    AllowCurrentMap = false, -- boolean, to allow a the current map in the map vote list.
    ExtraVotePower = 2,      -- number, how much extra vote power a user has
    Previews = {             -- table, preview settings
        Enabled = true,             -- boolean, are previews enabled?

        URL = "https://example.com/assets/maps/", -- string, a folder where the images are hosted
        InitializeWithCurrentMap = false -- boolean, whether or not we initalize the mapvote preview image with our current map (by default, it is a checkerboard image)

-- RTV config.

    MinPlayers = 3,   -- number, the minimum number of players that need to be online for RTV to work.
    VoteRatio = 0.66, -- number, what % of the server has to rtv to start a vote. 
    ChatCommands = {  -- array, chat commands that trigger an rtv vote
        "!rtv", "/rtv", "rtv"
    },
    Wait = 60         -- number, the "wait time" (how long a player has to wait before voting when the map changes) in seconds.
}

# Map Preview Configuration
1) In your config, enable previews by setting `Previews.Enabled` to `true`.
2) Host a folder on a webserver somewhere that has *direct* links of map preview images you want to display on the mapvote screen - a service like Google Drive will not work. Change `Previews.DBURL` to this folders URL.
  - The images name must be the same as the maps name (and must equal your configured image extension); for example, the map `ttt_xmas_nipperhouse` would be named `ttt_xmas_nipperhouse.jpg` on the webserver. 
3) Set the `Previews.ImageExtension` table property to the image extension. Note that The images must be all of the same format, and they must be browser friendly; .vtf images will not work.

# Map Pools
This allows you to add specific maps to your map pool based on certain server conditions.

MapVote.Pools is a table of functions; the value returned by each function dictates if said pool of maps is part of the mapvote.
```lua
-- example
MapVote.Pools = {
    general = function()
        return true
    end,
    christmas = function() -- this map pool would only be part of the mapvote when the month is december or january
        local month =  os.date("%B", os.time())
        return month == "December" or month == "January"
    end
}
```
It should be noted that if you use ULX or some other admin mod, these maps can still be voted for manually.

As a rule of thumb, you should make sure that the length of all pooled maps equals `MapVote.Config.MapLimit + MapVote.Config.MapsBeforeRevote` at all times.

MapVote.Pools = {}

# Maps
A table listing maps to their corresponding workshop IDs.

## Instructions
- First and foremost, the server must have these maps downloaded; this can be done by creating a Steam Workshop collection (or link this theoretical collection to an existing collection you're already using), and put 'em in there.
- Then simply set the convar `host_workshop_collection` to the ID of the workshop collection you just made.
The user will download each map as they are loaded on the server; a fallback map will be used if it does not exist on the server.

```lua
-- example
MapVote.Maps = {
    ["ttt_skyscraper"] = {
        id = "253328815",  -- string. this is the maps workshop id.
        pooled = "general" -- string, array of strings, or function. this is in which pool the map is pooled. if a function is passed, returning `true` will add it to the pool.
    },
    ["ttt_xmas_nipperhouse"] = {
        id = "1149578586",
        pooled = "xmas"
    }
}
```
]]
MapVote.Maps = {}

These two maps are special.
- MapVote.FallbackMap: The default map to "fallback" to if a current map isn't located on the server. If the fallback fails, it is hardcoded to go to gm_construct.
- MapVote.StartingMap: The starting map when your server launches. 
]]
MapVote.FallbackMap = "gm_construct"
MapVote.StartingMap = "gm_construct"
