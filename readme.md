# func_mapvote
A modified version of MapVote for the [func.zone TTT server](https://func.zone/ttt), based off of [tyrantelf's build of MapVote](https://github.com/tyrantelf/gmod-mapvote), originally created by [Willox](https://github.com/willox/). The latest archive of the original thread can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607103800/https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1268353).

This addon is based on [this fork](https://github.com/funczone/mapvote_with_previews) of the original mapvote addon. 

⚠️ **Major work in progress.**

## Features
- **Map pooling:** Load different groups of maps under different conditions.
  - This replaces your map system; maps are required to be loaded from the workshop, and clients download them via the addon.
- **Image previews:** Host images of maps onto a folder on the internet and load them onto the server on the fly and with ease via a DHTML panel.
- **Quality-of-Life additions:** Accidentally closed out of the MapVote window and want to change what you're voting for? Now you can.

# Installation + Configuration
**Please see `lua/mapvote/sample.sv_mapvote_config.lua` for complete installation and configuration.**
